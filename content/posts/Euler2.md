[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) hosts interesting mathematical/programming challenges. Quoting the site itself:

> The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems which follow.

In this post, I am presenting my solution to the first problem. I do not have the intention to spoil the problem for anyone. However, the solutions for the first 100 problems can be posted 

> as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.

The problem [can be found here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2). For convenience, I quoted verbatim here:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \ldots$$
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
