By education I am a Theoretical Physicist, then a Mathematical Engineer, and finally a Bioinformatics Post-Doc. Then, I worked as Teaching Assistant, a Lecturer, a Tutor.

Then, after so much time spent in Academia, I left it for exploring the Real World outside, and leveraged the Machine Learning I studied during the Post-Doc. I worked happily as Data Scientist, until my employer gave me the chance to learn wearing different hats, exploring new roles. Now, I do my best writing requirements, testing software, design novel algorithms, and learning Data Science (after so many years in the field).

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcocarnini/).

## What this site is about

This site does not use cookies to track incoming traffic. I am not interested in monetizing with advertisement, and I like to keep the design as simple as possible.

Also, I loved the compilation from [the website obesity crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm). So, I promise:

* not to include unnecessary images - they will all pass the [Taft test](https://tafttest.com/);
* no advertisement;
* no cookies;
* minimalistic design.
