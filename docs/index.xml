      <description>Project Euler hosts interesting mathematical/programming challenges. Quoting the site itself:
The first one-hundred or so problems are generally considered to be easier than the problems which follow.
In this post, I am presenting my solution to the first problem. I do not have the intention to spoil the problem for anyone. However, the solutions for the first 100 problems can be posted
as long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems.</description>

      <description>By education I am a Theoretical Physicist, then a Mathematical Engineer, and finally a Bioinformatics Post-Doc. Then, I worked as Teaching Assistant, a Lecturer, a Tutor.
Then, after so much time spent in Academia, I left it for exploring the Real World outside, and leveraged the Machine Learning I studied during the Post-Doc. I worked happily as Data Scientist, until my employer gave me the chance to learn wearing different hats, exploring new roles.</description>
