<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="Marco Carnini" width="200" height="200"></p>
<p>By education I am a Theoretical Physicist, then a Mathematical Engineer, and finally a Bioinformatics Post-Doc. Then, I worked as Teaching Assistant, a Lecturer, a Tutor.</p>
<p>Then, after so much time spent in Academia, I left it for exploring the Real World outside, and leveraged the Machine Learning I studied during the Post-Doc. I worked happily as Data Scientist, until my employer gave me the chance to learn wearing different hats, exploring new roles. Now, I do my best writing requirements, testing software, design novel algorithms, and learning Data Science (after so many years in the field).</p>
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcocarnini/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-site-is-about">What this site is about</h2>
<p>This site does not use cookies to track incoming traffic. I am not interested in monetizing with advertisement, and I like to keep the design as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Also, I loved the compilation from <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">the website obesity crisis</a>. So, I promise:</p>
<ul>
<li>not to include unnecessary images - they will all pass the <a href="https://tafttest.com/">Taft test</a>;</li>
<li>no advertisement;</li>
<li>no cookies;</li>
<li>minimalistic design.</li>
</ul>
